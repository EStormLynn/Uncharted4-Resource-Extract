Notes:
-For official package, you need a passcode to
 be able to view, list or extract it's contents.
-If you want to display package contents then
 enable 'List Contents' option under Extra menu
 but for official package you need to enable both
 'List Contents' and 'Ask for Passcode' options.
-If you want to save package title updates in
 json format then enable 'Save Updates' option.
-If you have a passcode for package then press
 on the 'save' button in the passcode window
 to save it to a binary file, so the application
 can load it automatically when opening the package
 without asking for it.
